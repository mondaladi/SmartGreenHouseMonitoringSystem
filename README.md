## Overview
This project is an **IoT-based Smart Greenhouse Monitoring System** using an **ESP8266** microcontroller. The system monitors temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity. It controls a water pump and LED light based on sensor readings and can be manually controlled via the **Blynk IoT app**.

## Wiring Connection
